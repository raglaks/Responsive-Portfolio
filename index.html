            <p><img id="pp" src="assets/images/cap.jpeg" alt="profile pic">I attended Stony Brook University and graduated in December, 2017, with a journalism degree and a digital arts minor. During my time at university, I dabbled into the editorial world and did a couple of internships in magazines based in New York City and its surroundings. My most notable <a href="http://archive.massappeal.com/los-blenders-ha-sido-album-mexico-city-garage-rock/" id="teal1" target="_blank">piece</a> was a feature story about Los Blenders—an underground garage act from Mexico City. It was published in Mass Appeal—a now defunct rap and NYC culture magazine.</p>
            <p>During my last year of college, I signed up for a few coding classes. My objective was to make my capstone project—a requirement of my degree—look and feel professional and up to the current standards. The end product was mostly okay because I quickly realized that I was only scratching the surface of web development.</p>
            <p>After graduation, I decided to fully focus my attention on learning web development. I figured that it could boost my editorial prospects. But after three or four months on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" id="teal2" target="_blank">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" id="teal3" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, I found myself enjoying the few skills that I had picked up. Eventually, I started looking for bootcamps, in Mexico City, to further better myself and hopefully start a career as a web developer in 2019.</p>
